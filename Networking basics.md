## What is a network

A network can be defined as a group of computers and devices that are connected between them in such way that they can send and receive (exchanging) data between the devices of such network.

  - Each of this devices has an address, which is unique for each device, this address acts as the identifier of such devices, e.g: 204.160.241.98. Some networks can also have a "name" that is more easily to remember for us, humans, e.g: www.javasoft.com, corresponding to the above numeric address.

 - We can think of any devices as a node connected to the graph that is a network.

## DNS: Domain Name System

 When we browse through the internet we usually see the address of the pages we are visiting like: : www.javasoft.com The DNS is responsible for converting a mnemonic textual internet address like the wikipedia one, into its hard numeric Internet Address, which in the case of javasoft would be 204.160.241.98.
